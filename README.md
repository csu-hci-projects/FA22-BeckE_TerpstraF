## Basic Rundown
You are a bear who wandered into a suburban neighborhood and were confused by a family as the mascot party entertainer they hired. Not one to waste an opportunity like this, you decided to go along with this deception. Your goal is to consume all of the food in the party without getting caught. The party guests wander through the map, and if they spot you eating food, being in bear mode, or eating a person, they will become suspicious that you may be a real bear. In order to lower guest suspicion, you can use the bright pink mascot tools, which lower your suspicion bar but raise your exhaustion bar. As a bear, you aren't really meant to walk bipedally, so the longer you walk around the map, the more tired you become. To relieve exhaustion, you can enter bear-mode. If your exhaustion bar fills and you do not enter bear mode within 5 seconds, your bear goes wild and is kicked out of the party.
