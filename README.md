## Basic Rundown
You are a bear who wandered into a suburban neighborhood and were confused by a family as the mascot party entertainer they hired. Not one to waste an opportunity like this, you decided to go along with this deception. Your goal is to consume all of the food in the party without getting caught. The party guests wander through the map, and if they spot you eating food, being in bear mode, or eating a person, they will become suspicious that you may be a real bear. In order to lower guest suspicion, you can use the bright pink mascot tools, which lower your suspicion bar but raise your exhaustion bar. As a bear, you aren't really meant to walk bipedally, so the longer you walk around the map, the more tired you become. To relieve exhaustion, you can enter bear-mode. If your exhaustion bar fills all the way your bear goes wild and is kicked out of the party.

## How to Play and Objectives
Your objective is to consume all items considered "snack items" in each mode. The counter and total for this is found in your stats menu. 
- Consume items by picking them up with the left or right grip buttons. Each item will take a moment to consume, so be careful of being seen if you're eating something you shouldn't be.
- Keep an eye on your suspicion and exhaustion bars. If either gets maxed out, it's game over.
- You can lower suspicion by consuming mascot tools, but be careful! This will also raise your exhaustion.
- You can lower exhaustion by consuming food or entering bear mode. Exhaustion will naturally raise over time when you aren't in bear mode. 
- When consuming food, be careful of any nearby guests, some of them may find this behavior suspicious.
- Consuming people completely relieves exhaustion but is seen as EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS to all guests.
- You can enter bear mode at any time by pressing the X button. This will relieve your exhaustion, but some guests may find it a little suspicious.
